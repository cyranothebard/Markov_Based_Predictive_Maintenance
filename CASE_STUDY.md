### Technical Architecture
```
Data Pipeline → Feature Engineering → Model Training → Calibration → Deployment
     ↓              ↓                    ↓              ↓            ↓
CMAPSS Loader → Rolling Features → Markov Chain → Linear Reg → API/MLOps
```

## 3. Technical Implementation

### Feature Engineering Pipeline
```python
# Key features implemented:

- Degradation indicators based on sensor trend analysis
- Health state classification (4-state progression)
- StandardScaler normalization for sensor data
- Comprehensive NaN handling and imputation
```

### Model Development
```python
class MarkovChainRUL:
    def __init__(self, n_states=4):
        self.n_states = n_states
        self.transition_matrix = None
        self.state_means = None
    
    def fit(self, X, y_states):
        # Learn transition probabilities from health states
        # Calculate state-specific RUL means
        
    def predict_rul(self, X):
        # Predict RUL using probability-weighted expected life
```

### Model Calibration
- **Linear regression post-processing** to improve prediction accuracy
- **Training on model predictions** to map outputs to actual RUL values
- **Performance improvement**: RMSE reduced from 67 to 49 cycles
