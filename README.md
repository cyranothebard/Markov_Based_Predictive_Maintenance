# Markov Predictive Maintenance with Time-Series Analysis

This project predicts machine health and detects failures using Markov Chains and time-series forecasting techniques. The solution incorporates telemetry data to improve operational efficiency and reduce downtime. It demonstrates skills in predictive modeling, time-series analysis, and dashboard development.

## Key Features

1. **Markov-Based Modeling**:
   - Predict future states of machines based on current state probabilities.
2. **Time-Series Forecasting**:
   - Use LSTMs to analyze telemetry data and forecast potential failures.
3. **Dashboard Visualization**:
   - Build interactive dashboards to monitor machine health and maintenance schedules.
